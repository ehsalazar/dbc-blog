					<p id="intro">Let&#39s look at three different websites. I&#39m going to discuss a bit about each and give my thoughts. First, I&#39ll explain why I&#39m focusing on this particular website. Additionally I&#39ll be considering the purpose of the site. Next, what do I think of the design and it&#39s visual impact. I&#39ll also share my perspective on the site&#39s content and layout. Finally, I&#39ll let you in on my connection or feelings about the particular site. Let&#39s jump in.</p>

					<h4><a href="https://www.drbronner.com/" target="_blank">drbronner.com</a></h4>

					<p>I&#39m a fan of Dr. Bronner&#39s both for their products and for their company philosophies. Their website is primarily for commerce with a secondary purpose of educating its consumers. From a design perspective, I find the website clean and simple. Adjectives I would also equate to its product. I find the site to be vibrant, impactful and appealing. Build upon a white and light grey backdrop, it adds statement photographs to draw you in. As for layout, the site is functional and easy to navigate. The homepage&#39s large body image provides a call to action while below are five additional topics to consider. Overall, I enjoy exploring the site. It makes me proud of the product the company provides while also leaving me more informed and better educated.</p>

					<h4><a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/" target="_blank">fivethirtyeight.com</a></h4>

					<p>This site is a relatively new addition to the crowded pool of online news outlets. Its primary purpose is to inform its users from a data driven perspective. What I like about this site is how it goes about that and how it sets its self apart from other outlets. I find the site&#39s design to be straight forward and uncomplicated. It makes impactful use of color in its menus and article pages while remaining uncluttered and tasteful. The content of the site is purposeful and engaging, with the end user in mind. The colored menus established on the homepage translate throughout the site for ease and relatability. While I wasn&#39t drawn to the site for its sports articles as most are, I find I&#39ve come to appreciate its other features including often ingenious uses of charts and graphs.</p>

					<h4><a href="http://fancy.com/" target="_blank">fancy.com</a></h4>

					<p>I&#39ve been a fancy fan for a few years. I checkout the site more as a window shopper rather than an actual shopper. That might not align with the sites purpose of commerce but I enjoy it none the less. To imagine the site&#39s design, think curated shopping. Built on a clean and cool background, the product&#39s images are elegant and ordered. The square detailed images on the homepage give a gallery impression. Only a small amount of informational text is added until you click through to learn more. The layout is customizable within limits to ensure its refined nature remains intact. It&#39s approachable but can become more complicated as social aspects and purchasing began to tie in. I&#39ve yet to buy from the site but I am charmed and inspired by its presentation and unique products.</p>

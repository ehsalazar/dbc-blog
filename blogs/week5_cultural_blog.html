					<p id="intro">When I think of Silicon Valley or the technology industry more broadly, I equate it with white, straight men. While the lack of diversity and broader representation isn't a new issue, it’s one that can seem at conflict with what is often seen as tech’s ideals and transformative visions. Many tech company speak of building the future or creating new possibilities. However, they are often driven from a singular or at best, limited vision.</p> 

					<p>Of course, this isn't to paint the industry with broad strokes but it’s hard to dispute statistics that often put women’s representation in the low 20% range and even more dire for African Americans and Hispanics which are in the single digit percentages. That data isn't the easies to come by either. It’s often not disclosed or buried in a deep lack of transparency. Many companies are actively seeking to diversify their ranks but it’s been a slow and often times difficult struggle. The causes are many, from education to recruiting, from cultural barriers to socioeconomic opportunities and so on. While it’s encouraging to see new focus and light being cast on the topic, often solutions become band-aids rather than cures for the ailment.</p>

					<p>One new solution that has recently gained press is rooted in tech’s approach to other issues it has sought to fix. What if we could code a solution? Entelo, a software startup, is working with algorithms towards that end. It seeks to provide companies with candidates that match a variety of qualifying backgrounds, including race, sex, and military service by mining that information from the candidate’s social media presence. While this approach is still very new, I can't help but think that yes, it could help diversify teams and fill quotas but how does it impact core issues.</p>

					<p>Again, it’s encouraging to see companies actively seeking to diversify their teams and even companies like Entelo offering solutions. Only time will tell how much transformation and ground can be gained by minorities in the coming years. Meanwhile, I continue to be inspired by educational institutions like Dev Bootcamp and others, such as Hackbright Academy which seek to fill gaps in representation as well as seek to raise the conversation.</p>

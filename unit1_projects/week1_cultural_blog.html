			<h3>Week 1 - Cultural Blog</h3>

			<p>When I think about the times in my life that I&#39ve been the proudest, happiest or most satisfied, the value that comes to mind is Public Service or Service more generally.</p>

			<p>I can remember back to my years after college. It was during this phase that I participated in the <a href="http://www.upwithpeople.org/">Up with People</a> organization. I was originally drawn to the program for its performance aspects. While I do have fond memories of that, it was the service aspects that changed me the most. A large component of the program was that in each town or city we performed in, the cast participated in some sort of community project. Whether I was painting a mural, teaching inner city elementary students or visiting the often forgotten in a nursing home, the goal was the same, being of service.</p>

			<p>Even more recently in professional life as a Manager. When I think about being a leader to my team, it was through my service to them that I achieved the most success. In identifying their needs and goals, I was able to establish a path where I could help them reach those things to the benefit of all parties. Whether I was helping a front line employee master their customer service skills, creating a cooperative environment for my team to reach our monthly goals or supporting a team member that was hungry for a promotion to obtain the skills necessary to land that promotion, the goal was the same, being of service.</p>

			<p>When I think about the times in my life that I&#39ve been the proudest, happiest or most satisfied, it has been when I was at service to others. I&#39d like to say that in general, I always try to live up to that value. Truth be told, I can just as easily think of times when I&#39ve subverted that value for monetary gain, status or just because I perceived it easier not to. Those are also the times in my life that I&#39ve not been the proudest, happiest or even slightly satisfied. In those times the goal was self service.</p>

			<p>Now as I look to start a new chapter in my life, both personally and professionally, I call upon that value. Whether it&#39s a peer asking for help on debugging their code or working through a challenge, a friend calling to ask about career advice or a former colleague seeking guidance in dealing with a new supervisor, the goal will be the same, being of service.</p>

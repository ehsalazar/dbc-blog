    <p>In my quest to become a web developer I’ve been exposed to a few different coding languages. While I’m sure I’ll be learning many more, so far I’ve become familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Ruby. What has struck me, is the ubiquitous nature of JavaScript. If your not familiar, JavaScript is a dynamic, mostly object-based programming language. In simple terms, that means that within the language, we can not only create objects but also manipulate them. JavaScript (JS for shorthand) is most often considered a scripting language that can run locally from a user’s web browser.</p>

<p><img src="../images/js.jpg" alt="JavaScript Logo" width="100%" /></p>

<p>If you’ve ever opened up your web browser and gone to your favorite site, you have in all likelihood, encountered JS running in the background. It’s what helps transform a static website into an interactive site. Log into a social media site…interactive. Log into a shopping site…interactive. Accessed your favorite site on your mobile device…more than likely, interactive.</p>

<p>Developed in the mid-1990’s, JS spent its early years not feeling much love as it was seen as a tool for beginners and people writing for the web rather than a true programming language used to build the back-end side of advanced software programs. By the early-2000’s however, it was picking up attention and praise. And now, in the last few years, JS has become one of the most ubiquitous and popular languages on the web.</p>

<p>This progression make sense, especially when you consider how we as a society have evolved and embraced the web into many aspects of our daily lives. The addition of mobile devices has served to intensify this growth and popularity. We no longer want to just look at a website, we want to interact with it and have it respond to us, making for the perfect marriage between HTML and JS.</p>

<h3 id="learn-more">Learn More</h3>

<p>While this has shown just a quick bit of love to JavaScript, these resources have been beneficial in my understanding.</p>

  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>So you’ve been getting to know a little about CSS. Perhaps you’ve learned that your HTML is built using tags which create elements. For example, you might have seen <code>header</code>, <code>nav</code>, <code>div</code> and <code>p</code>. You can style those elements in CSS with all kinds of fun modifications. Before you jump in to far however, you should know a little about how those elements display by default and how you can modify them.</p>

<h3 id="block">Block</h3>

<p>By default, many of the more common elements will display as blocks. Basically, that means they will take up the entire width of the area they’re in. For example, a <code>p</code> which is a paragraph element will fill a column entirely with its text. Let’s have a look.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="html"><span class="nt">&lt;body&gt;</span>
	<span class="nt">&lt;section&gt;</span>
		<span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer elit, sed diam. Dolore 
		magna erat volutpat. Ullamcorper suscipit lobortis nisl ut aliquip 
		ex ea commodo conseqat.<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
	<span class="nt">&lt;/section&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/body&gt;</span></code></pre></div>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="css"><span class="nt">section</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">margin</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">3em</span> <span class="k">auto</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="k">width</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">40</span><span class="o">%</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="k">border</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">2px</span> <span class="k">solid</span> <span class="nb">navy</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="k">padding</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">1em</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="nt">p</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">background-color</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nb">orange</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></div>

<p><img src="../images/block.png" alt="Result" width="100%" /></p>

<p>I’ve added a bit of styling to create our section border. As for the paragraph, I’ve only added some back ground color. You can see the <code>p</code> element fills the entire space.</p>

<h3 id="inline">Inline</h3>

<p>Now let’s look at inline. While <code>p</code> had a default display of block, tags such as <code>em</code> and <code>strong</code> have default display of inline. Basically, they display that element inline with its surroundings but they are contained by their surrounds dimensions. Let’s take a look.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="html"><span class="nt">&lt;body&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;section&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer elit, sed diam. Dolore 
    magna erat volutpat. Ullamcorper suscipit <span class="nt">&lt;strong&gt;</span>lobortis<span class="nt">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> 
    nisl ut aliquip ex ea commodo conseqat.<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/section&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/body&gt;</span></code></pre></div>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="css"><span class="nt">strong</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">background-color</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nb">yellow</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></div>

<p><img src="../images/inline.png" alt="Result" /></p>

<p>A <code>strong</code> tag is quick way to bold a particular element. I again added only some background color to this element. You can see it is within or inline with its surrounds with our changing its dimensions.</p>

<h3 id="inline-block">Inline-block</h3>

<p>What about inline-block. Well this allows us to create a new block element. This time however, while it continues to be within or inline with its surroundings, we can adjust its dimensions. Let’s take a look.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="css"><span class="nt">strong</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">background-color</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nb">yellow</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="k">display</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">inline</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="k">block</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="k">text-align</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">center</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="k">width</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">6em</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="k">height</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">3em</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></div>

<p><img src="../images/inline_block.png" alt="Result" /></p>

<p>By adding changing the display value of the strong element to inline-block, we created a whole new block that we were able to scale. While I used text and <code>strong</code> to walk through these examples, perhaps a more common and useful use of inline-block is with <code>img</code> elements. This allows you to add images within the context of it surrounding text without filling the entire width of the section.</p>

    <h3 id="my-website-20">My Website 2.0</h3>

<p>This week we are working to makeover our index.html page or rather our homepage for the site we are building. There are a few things I want to consider as I proceed with this challenge. First, I plan on cleaning or streaming lining the overall look of the site. Previously, I felt it was a bit busy. Second, I want to make a clearer presentation of navigation choices. I think to achieve this, I’ll break the menu into two section, one for general navigation and social media then another section for blog posts and projects.</p>

<p>In order to complete this challenge, I’ll be working in steps. I need to establish a wireframe or blue print for how I would like the site to look.</p>

<p><img src="../images/index_wireframe.png" alt="Index Wireframe" width="100%" /></p>

<p>Then I’ll have to jump into the actual coding of the HTML and CSS files. Finally, I’ll commit and sync all my changes through Github which is hosting my site.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Let’s look at three different websites. I’m going to discuss a bit about each and give my thoughts. First, I’ll explain why I’m focusing on this particular website. Additionally I’ll be considering the purpose of the site. Next, what do I think of the design and its visual impact. I’ll also share my perspective on the site’s content and layout. Finally, I’ll let you in on my connection or feelings about the particular site. Let’s jump in.</p>

<h3 id="drbronnercomhttpswwwdrbronnercom"><a href="https://www.drbronner.com/">drbronner.com</a></h3>

<p>I’m a fan of Dr. Bronner’s both for their products and for their company philosophies. Their website is primarily for commerce with a secondary purpose of educating its consumers. From a design perspective, I find the website clean and simple. Adjectives I would also equate to its product. I find the site to be vibrant, impactful and appealing. Build upon a white and light grey backdrop, it adds statement photographs to draw you in. As for layout, the site is functional and easy to navigate. The homepage’s large body image provides a call to action while below are five additional topics to consider. Overall, I enjoy exploring the site. It makes me proud of the product the company provides while also leaving me more informed and better educated.</p>

<h3 id="fivethirtyeightcomhttpfivethirtyeightcom"><a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/">fivethirtyeight.com</a></h3>

<p>This site is a relatively new addition to the crowded pool of online news outlets. Its primary purpose is to inform its users from a data driven perspective. What I like about this site is how it goes about that and how it sets its self apart from other outlets. I find the site’s design to be straight forward and uncomplicated. It makes impactful use of color in its menus and article pages while remaining uncluttered and tasteful. The content of the site is purposeful and engaging, with the end user in mind. The colored menus established on the homepage translate throughout the site for ease and relatability. While I wasn’t drawn to the site for its sports articles as most are, I find I’ve come to appreciate its other features including often ingenious uses of charts and graphs.</p>

<h3 id="fancycomhttpfancycom"><a href="http://fancy.com/">fancy.com</a></h3>

<p>I’ve been a fancy fan for a few years. I checkout the site more as a window shopper rather than an actual shopper. That might not align with the sites purpose of commerce but I enjoy it none the less. To imagine the site’s design, think curated shopping. Built on a clean and cool background, the product’s images are elegant and ordered. The square detailed images on the homepage give a gallery impression. Only a small amount of informational text is added until you click through to learn more. The layout is customizable within limits to ensure its refined nature remains intact. It’s approachable but can become more complicated as social aspects and purchasing began to tie in. I’ve yet to buy from the site but I am charmed and inspired by its presentation and unique products.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>When I think about the times in my life that I’ve been the proudest, happiest or most satisfied, the value that comes to mind is Public Service or Service more generally.</p>

<p><img src="../images/values.png" alt="Values" width="100%" /></p>

<p>I can remember back to my years after college. It was during this phase that I participated in the <a href="http://www.upwithpeople.org">Up with People</a> organization. I was originally drawn to the program for its performance aspects. While I do have fond memories of that, it was the service aspects that changed me the most. A large component of the program was that in each town or city we performed in, the cast participated in some sort of community project. Whether I was painting a mural, teaching inner city elementary students or visiting the often forgotten in a nursing home, the goal was the same, being of service.</p>

<p>Even more recently in professional life as a Manager. When I think about being a leader to my team, it was through my service to them that I achieved the most success. In identifying their needs and goals, I was able to establish a path where I could help them reach those things to the benefit of all parties. Whether I was helping a front line employee master their customer service skills, creating a cooperative environment for my team to reach our monthly goals or supporting a team member that was hungry for a promotion to obtain the skills necessary to land that promotion, the goal was the same, being of service.</p>

<p>When I think about the times in my life that I’ve been the proudest, happiest or most satisfied, it has been when I was at service to others. I’d like to say that in general, I always try to live up to that value. Truth be told, I can just as easily think of times when I’ve subverted that value for monetary gain, status or just because I perceived it easier not to. Those are also the times in my life that I’ve not been the proudest, happiest or even slightly satisfied. In those times the goal was self service.</p>

<p>Now as I look to start a new chapter in my life, both personally and professionally, I call upon that value. Whether it’s a peer asking for help on debugging their code or working through a challenge, a friend calling to ask about career advice or a former colleague seeking guidance in dealing with a new supervisor, the goal will be the same, being of service.</p>

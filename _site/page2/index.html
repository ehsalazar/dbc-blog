  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>When I think of Silicon Valley or the technology industry more broadly, I equate it with white, straight men. While the lack of diversity and broader representation isn’t a new issue, it’s one that can seem at conflict with what is often seen as tech’s ideals and transformative visions. Many tech company speak of building the future or creating new possibilities. However, they are often driven from a singular or at best, limited vision.</p>

<p><img src="../images/hands.jpg" alt="Multicultural Raised Hands" width="100%" /></p>

<p>Of course, this isn’t to paint the industry with broad strokes but it’s hard to dispute statistics that often put women’s representation in the low 20% range and even more dire for African Americans and Hispanics which are in the single digit percentages. That data isn’t the easies to come by either. It’s often not disclosed or buried in a deep lack of transparency. Many companies are actively seeking to diversify their ranks but it’s been a slow and often times difficult struggle. The causes are many, from education to recruiting, from cultural barriers to socioeconomic opportunities and so on. While it’s encouraging to see new focus and light being cast on the topic, often solutions become band-aids rather than cures for the ailment.</p>

<p>One new solution that has recently gained press is rooted in tech’s approach to other issues it has sought to fix. What if we could code a solution? Entelo, a software startup, is working with algorithms towards that end. It seeks to provide companies with candidates that match a variety of qualifying backgrounds, including race, sex, and military service by mining that information from the candidate’s social media presence. While this approach is still very new, I can’t help but think that yes, it could help diversify teams and fill quotas but how does it impact core issues.</p>

<p>Again, it’s encouraging to see companies actively seeking to diversify their teams and even companies like Entelo offering solutions. Only time will tell how much transformation and ground can be gained by minorities in the coming years. Meanwhile, I continue to be inspired by educational institutions like Dev Bootcamp and others, such as Hackbright Academy which seek to fill gaps in representation as well as seek to raise the conversation.</p>

    <p>As we’ve discussed in the past, Ruby is an object-oriented programming language. Almost everything in Ruby is an object. Those objects are what allow us to build and execute different programs. One of the ways Ruby organizes all of these objects is into classes. “Hello, World!” is a member of the String class. 7 is a member of the Fixnum class. Members of the same class will have similar attributes and methods they can access.</p>

<p>One of the cool things about Ruby is that we aren’t limited to the built in classes like Strings and Fixnum, we can create our own. Once we do, we can create objects that will be members of that class and will have access to the methods we specify. Check out this example.</p>

<p>Let’s break down what we’ve created starting from the top and work our way down. First, we created our <code>Students</code> class. We then set a class variable (identified by the <code>@@</code>) of count to zero. It’s a class variable in that the object <code>Students</code> will be able to access it’s value. Next we defined our <code>initialize</code> method. Think of this as the “boot up” method that every member of <code>Students</code> will go through. Within it, we set instance variables (identified by the <code>@</code>) equal to the values we enter for each member. We also incremented our class variable.</p>

<p>We then created a <code>register</code> instance method that our members can call on once they join the class. In this case, the method will return a string or sentence. We went on to create a <code>get_count</code> method that the <code>Students</code> class can access but the individual members can not. This too is returning a string or sentence.</p>

<p>With our class <code>Students</code> done, we now just have to instantiate or create each individual member. We did this by giving the member a variable which we associated with the building method and passed it three parameters. We then could call on our instance method using our instance members. Finally, we called on the class method to give us our class count. Here’s the output from the last three lines of our code.</p>

  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Conflict is all around us. One person thinks this. Another company does that. You did this. I do that. When conflict does arise, how do you deal with it? More over, how did you feel after the conflict? Well, for most of us, when confronted with conflict we process through it and the subsequent shame in one of four ways. As described by the <a href="http://southdown.on.ca/publications/articles/Compass-of-Shame.pdf">Compass of Shame</a>, we either go into withdrawal, attack self, avoidance or attack others.</p>

<p><img src="../images/keep_calm.jpg" alt="Keep Calm and Carry On" width="100%" /></p>

<p>Let me share a personal example of conflict and what I’ve learned through hindsight. Early on in my career, I was working as a Sales Associate for a retail company. I was young but wanted to do well and advance. One day, a guest entered our store and inquired about a return. I offered to assist the gentleman. In going through the steps to complete his request, I discovered he didn’t possess an invoice for the item he wanted to return. I explained that the company policy required the original invoice and without it I wouldn’t be able to assist.</p>

<p>As you can imagine, this didn’t sit well with him and he quickly became angered and began berating me. In my head, I felt like I was doing the right thing. I was following my companies policies and procedures and ultimately it wasn’t my fault he didn’t retain his receipt. I soon began to feel inferior and seek ways to withdraw from the situation. It escalated to the point of him demanding to speak to my superior until he was able to get his way.</p>

<p>What I’ve learned about conflict and my reaction to it, especially after a situation like this, is two fold. In the immediate sense, while I was “right” in following policies, it left the guest promising never to shop with us again and it left me feeling beaten up. Things aren’t always, and in fact usually aren’t, black and white. You have to have flexibility to adapt, respond and ultimately be proactive in situations. In a bigger picture sense, I’ve also learned that conflict isn’t necessarily a good thing or a bad thing. It’s just something that is. Its our responses to it and what we decide its meaning that influence us.</p>

<p>I can’t control the actions of an upset guest but I can control whether I allow how he deals with conflict influence how I feel or deal with it. I can control whether to stay calm and deal with it or rather delve into shame and one of its outcomes. While it’s not always achievable, it’s definitely something I strive for. Perhaps the British of the late 1930’s, as they prepared to enter into World War II, had it best summarized. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep_Calm_and_Carry_On">“Keep Calm and Carry On”</a></p>

    <p>Ruby is a dynamic programming language that offers many classes or modules for the programmer to utilize, such as String, Integer, Array, and Hash. One that is quickly becoming one of my go to favorites is the Enumerable module. It gives us some nifty methods in which we can traverse, search, sort and even alter elements within a collection class.</p>

<p>Today we’re going to learn about one of its methods, group_by, otherwise known as Enumberable#group_by. It’s a handy little guy that can power through an array or hash and group its elements. The method itself usually takes a block of code that tells it what exactly to group by. Its output is a new hash or collection with the keys you selected and values that match up to them. Perhaps it’s easier seen than said, let’s take a look at a few examples.</p>

<h3 id="example-using-a-collection-of-numbers">Example using a collection of numbers:</h3>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">.</span><span class="mi">15</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">group_by</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="n">num</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">num</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c1"># =&gt; {1=&gt;[1, 4, 7, 10, 13], 2=&gt;[2, 5, 8, 11, 14], 3=&gt;[3, 6, 9, 12, 15]}</span></code></pre></div>

<p>We took a group of numbers from 1 through 15 and called the group_by method. The block we passed to the method is telling it to loop through those numbers. It then grouped the numbers if they were divisible by 3. The method then created a hash with those groups. Numbers that were evenly divisible by 3 went to the :0 key, numbers with a remainder of 1 went to the :1 key, and finally numbers with a remainder of 2 went to the :2 key.</p>

<p>This time we created a collection of movie titles. We then called the group_by method on the movie array. The block we passed to the method is telling it to loop through the titles. It then grouped them by their first letter. The method then created a hash with those groups. The first letter of the titles became the keys and titles themselves, the values.</p>

<p>As you can see, it’s not hard understanding how useful group_by can be. If you’re looking to loop through collections and organize their elements, this method should be in your toolbox. If you want to learn more, explore these resources.</p>

    <p>The curriculum that Dev Bootcamp has developed is broken down into phases. Phase 0 is nine weeks of remote learning followed by nine weeks of in-person learning encompassing Phase 1 - 3. I’m coming to the end of week three in the Phase 0 curriculum and have already learned a good amount, both in the technical sense but also in what I can expect from the Dev Bootcamp culture when I step foot into an actual classroom.</p>

<h3 id="kitchen-or-table">Kitchen or Table</h3>

<p><img src="../images/chef.jpg" alt="Chef in Kitchen" width="100%" /></p>

<p>This past week,  we watched a video entitled “Fireside Chat with Shereef.” In essence, it was a welcome Q&amp;A chat hosted by, Shereef Bishay, one of the founders of Dev Bootcamp. In it, he shared the history and evolution of the program as well as shared his hopes for the new students to come. He also made an interesting distinction or analogy concerning the culture of the program which is largely shaped by each new cohort or group of students beginning their journey.</p>

<p>The analogy goes as follows. Most participants who enter the program come with one of two mindsets. Either they look to be a consumer or a creator. The consumer sits at the table and orders a product of the menu. They pay this in exchange for that. The creator on the other hand, enters the kitchen and seeks to make something. They ask, if I put this into the recipe, what can I get out in return. There was no judgement of either of the mindsets, and in fact many will fluctuate between both at different times. There was however, some distinction in the outcomes said mindsets could offer.</p>

<p>While the consumer/table is typical and in many ways natural in our culture, it can be safe and as such limiting. The creator/kitchen however, takes risk but offers potential rewards. I can walk into Dev Bootcamp or any situation for that matter and say “this doesn’t look as I expected” or “I want what I paid for.” Alternatively, I can walk into Dev Bootcamp and say “how can I contribute to the outcomes” or “what if by sharing I can enrich someone besides myself.”</p>

<p>I understand that curriculum, programs and companies change and evolve. I would expect nothing less, especially entering into a technology industry. A popular coding language today might be very different only one or two years from now. By moving beyond ordering a tool off the menu and rather looking at how I can contribute to the industry’s recipe, I become party to the outcome. I too am changing and evolving. Even in only three weeks, through online communities and groups, video chats, emails and messaging, we’ve started to build a dynamic new culture. I’m immensely excited for Phase 1 and meeting everyone in person and taking that culture to a whole new level.</p>

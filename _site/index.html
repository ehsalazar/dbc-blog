    <h3 id="my-website-30">My Website 3.0</h3>

<p>I’ve learned an amazing amount of technical knowledge over the course of the last eight weeks. When I began DBC’s Phase 0, I only had a shallow understanding of HTML and CSS, let alone git, JavaScript, and Ruby. Now, as this phase comes to a close and I’ll soon be immersed in Phase 1, I wanted to update my site to be more functional, easier to manage and overall, more professional. </p>

<h4 id="out-with-the-old">Out with the Old</h4>

<p><img src="../images/oldsite.png" alt="Screenshot of previous site design" width="100%" /></p>

<p>There were a few things I wanted to accomplish as I set out to upgrade this site. First, as I’m writing more and more blog post, I needed a way to manage that process. It would also be a big help if I could automate some the work put in to each blog post. Second, while I thought the design of the site was sufficient, it still had a “made in 1995” feel about it. I knew I wanted to step up the design aspects as well as introduce a few more features.</p>

<h4 id="jekyll">Jekyll</h4>

<p>To tackle my first concern, I looked into a few different static site generators and management tools such as Middleman, Octopress and Docpad. Ultimately, I chose to go with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. It’s powered by Ruby and runs using Gems. Some of the great features it includes are code highlighting using Pygments’ syntax, blog structuring and pagination, and the ability to create and execute posts using Markdown. Being a still relative newbie, it took a good day or two for me to figure it out and jump into with both feet. I have a basic understanding and I’m looking forward to learning more about its customizable options. </p>

<h4 id="hpstr">HPSTR</h4>

<p>The next obstacle was in tackling the overall design. I’m proud that I was able to learn enough to get my site to look relatively good. I sought out elements I liked and taught myself how to execute them using either HTML or CSS. That said, I knew there was more I could do. I’d been exploring the possibility of utilizing Bootstrap and some of the many themes and options they provide. As I learned more about Bootstrap, I began to notice its prevalence everywhere. In the end, I found what they offered to be a bit much for my needs and it left me wanting for something a bit more unique. </p>

<p>That’s when I came across <a href="http://mademistakes.com/about/">Michael Rose</a>, a designer out of NY state. He’s an amazing artist that does unbelievable things utilizing tools such his iPad and apps like <a href="http://www.fiftythree.com/paper">Paper by 53</a>. On top of that, he’s built some cool themes based around Jekyll’s functionality and has shared them with the world on Github. I chose to access his <a href="http://mademistakes.com/articles/hpstr-jekyll-theme/">HPSTR Theme</a> and have found it a great match for my needs. It has a modern and minimal design with a focus on clean typography while remaining creative and artistic in a way that I felt many technical blogs lack. </p>

<h4 id="whats-next">What’s Next</h4>

<p>This site transition has been educational and enjoyable. I’m confident I continue to spruce up sections and element here and there as I continue to get feedback from my readers. I also hope to transition to a personal URL in the near future. If you’re at all interested in learning more about this process or utilizing some of these tools as well. I suggest checking out these resources that I found incredibly helpful and inspirational.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>A few weeks back we looked at a <a href="http://ehsalazar.github.io">value reflection</a>. In it, I examined a particular value that has had some significance to my life and expounded on its impact. The value in question, was that of public service or being of service to others. I’ve always found joy as well as opportunities to learn when I’ve embraced that value. As I’ve experienced in the last few weeks, that same value can also hold keys to mitigating something we talked about last week, <a href="http://ehsalazar.github.io">stereotype threat</a>.</p>

<h3 id="a-public-service-announcement">A Public Service Announcement</h3>

<p><img src="../images/psa.png" alt="Public Service Announcement" width="100%" /></p>

<p>I’ve learned many lessons from my parents and perhaps one of the most profound has centered around public service. I was always taught and encourage that whenever I had too much going on or was facing uncertain times, that in those moments, I should put down my burdens and help someone else. It’s been a great tool to minimize stress and even anxiety. I’ve found, when placed in a role of public servant, suddenly my own issues diminish. They may not disappear but they began to see new possibilities and solutions I might have otherwise overlooked.</p>

<p>There will be obstacles as I begin my journey into a new career and life within the tech industry. Not only do I have a wealth of knowledge yet to learn but I’ll likely also have to deal with the real possibility of stereotype threat. It can be daunting to look out upon a pool of prospective colleagues and suddenly realize there are very few with whom you share a culture or group. It can even have you believe that perhaps this isn’t the field for someone like you. Whether in those moments or in times when the work or education load seems unbearable, that I’ll turn to public service.</p>

<p>One of the many benefits to a program like Dev Bootcamp is its deep philosophy surrounding pair programming. Not only does it help prepare us with tools that are becoming more and more the industry standard, but it also provides us an outlet to work with our peers. We are able to work cooperatively seeking solutions to challenges. I’ve learned over the last few weeks, that it also provides an opportunity to reaffirm my values. I may be stressed after working hours on a problem set that I can’t seem to solve and the last thing I want to do is sit down and work with someone else. But I do, and suddenly the experience becomes transformative.</p>

<p>My experience so far, has been, that we start working together and opportunities arise where I realize there are things I do know and beyond that, that I can perhaps step out into service and help my partner learn them as well. The relationship is reciprocal, they too share their knowledge with me. Before we know it, we are both coming to solutions that we perhaps wouldn’t have found on our own.</p>

<p>Whether it’s a simple example of pair programming or finding some other opportunity to be of service to someone else, the experience is the same. I’m out of my head and not focusing on what I perceive as things I can’t do or can’t learn or don’t belong. The realization and comfort comes that I am on the right path, and that it can only be enhanced in the service of the community around me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>As far as embedded databases go, SQLite is a popular choice. It’s a relational database management system that follows much of SQL standards. Since it needs no standalone processes, its library communicates and links with the server becoming an inherent component utilized by many web browsers. It’s ACID-compliant (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) and uses a dynamic yet weakly typed syntax. This is where things can begin to go wrong. That syntax doesn’t ensure the domain or database integrity.</p>

<p><img src="../images/syringes.jpg" alt="Three Empty Syringes" width="100%" /></p>

<p>We’ve become more accustomed to hearing about security breaches and compromised databases. We think we’re protected by our favorite online shopping site or social network but then we receive the dreaded notice of hacks and prompts to update our passwords. While not all compromises are generated out of SQLite, it’s unfortunately a relatively easy program to manipulate and thus a popular option for those seeking to attack.</p>

<p>The typical embedded database, such as those utilized by web applications, populate its data when we enter in the requested information such as our names, email addresses and passwords. While that’s what we typically do, that’s not what an attacker does. Rather than inputting say, an email address, they can enter or inject a relatively simple line of code. That could prompt the database to output all types of sensitive data or even corrupt and bring down the database all together.</p>

<p>So how do we guard from such attacks? As consumers, we of course remain diligent with updating our passwords and selecting two-step verification when available. From the programmers perspective, there are also steps that can be taken to guard against such compromises. Website entry forms and consumer end-points can be coded to not just accept what’s inputted. Rather, they can utilize input validation techniques such as expected input matching and authentication based on defined rules such as length, type and syntax. They can also be coded to parameterize query APIs with placeholder substitution markers. Finally, programmers and companies alike can utilizing encryption of the data. This way, regardless of  where the compromise generated, the stolen data would be less useful.</p>

  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>The theory of stereotype threat describes the possibility of (often unconsciously) experiencing anxiety that can lead to negative outcomes, when in situations where we believe we may confirm a stereotype about the groups we identify with. While it’s a common held belief today and well studied, it was first introduced in 1995 in the experiments conducted by Psychologists Dr. Claude Steele together with Dr. Joshua Aronson.</p>

<p><img src="../images/wv.jpg" alt="Whistling Vivaldi (Bookcover) - Claude Steele" width="100%" /></p>

<p>In short, their experiments examined the role of race in test scores of African-American college students compared to European-American students. They found, that when race was emphasized, the African-American students performed poorly. However, when race was deemphasized, the African-American students performed better or equal to their European-American counterparts. Many studies have been done since, replicating their findings as well as examining the performances of other groups including those based on race, sex, age, religion, sexual orientation and even socioeconomic and political affiliations.</p>

<p>As I discussed last week, there’s a diversity problem in tech. What role if any could stereotype threat play in that problem? When looked through a gender filter, perhaps it can began to explain why so few women work in tech or even pursue a STEM based education. The same could be said when looking through a race filter in examining low percentages of African-Americans and Hispanics in the technology sector.</p>

<p>I’m a relative newcomer to tech and just now beginning to explore an education and eventually a career path in that direction. Apart from being aware of the diversity problem in tech, I can’t say I have personally experienced it. That’s not to say I haven’t experienced stereotype threat elsewhere. As a gay man, I’ve experienced it. Not so much in academic settings but in professional and other social settings. I can remember presenting my work to colleagues and being hyper-aware of my sexuality and not wanting to align with stereotypes or being perceived as too feminine or too “gay.” I can remember having those same feelings even just walking down the street.</p>

<p>Societal norms have shifted a great deal in the last couple of decades, especially concerning the LGBT communities. Passing as straight, fitting in or aligning with traditional gender roles isn’t as big of an issue as it once was. The gains in overcoming stereotype threat have come from not only awareness but also visibility. That, I believe can be a tool in minimizing the threat in other areas as well. We can more easily refute the threat and overcome the anxiety when we can see and identify with a trans* actor on television or the female CEO transforming the tech industry or an African-American excelling in education going on to become President.</p>

<p>If you’d like to explore this topic more, there’s a wealth of information online including more studies, other remedies, and even counter-arguments. To start, consider the following resources.</p>

</ul>

<p>Being aware of stereotype threat or at least being aware of the impact the groups we identify with can have on our outcomes is a worthy pursuit. It can help us when we’re in homogeneous situations and more importantly, when we’re not.</p>

  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>As we learn more about Ruby as a programming language, we get to explore the many ways in which we can interact with, alter and change objects. Three dynamic and useful tools towards that end are blocks, Procs and lambdas. Let’s learn a little about each and how we can utilize them in our code.</p>

<h3 id="blocks">Blocks</h3>

<p>You can think of blocks as useful little add-ons that interact with certain methods. They are especially useful when iterating using methods like #each or #times. They are also key to the success of methods like #collect and #select. Blocks can be built using either <code>do…end</code> syntax or more commonly, the <code>{ }</code> syntax.</p>

<h3 id="procs">Procs</h3>

<p>In Ruby, almost everything is an object. One of the few exceptions to that rule are blocks. They aren’t objects and as such have a limited function. They aren’t embedded with all the powers and abilities of objects. Also, if you plan on using the same block more than once, you’ll need to retype it again and again. Here’s where Procs come in. Procs are objects and as such, can be used to convert our little blocks into more powerful objects that can be used over and over.</p>

<h3 id="lambdas">Lambdas</h3>

<p>Much like Procs, lambdas are also objects. They function very similarly to Procs and can sometimes be used interchangeably. They do have one distinct behavior difference that can have an impact on output. When used within a method, a lambda will execute and then pass control back to the calling method. A Proc on the other hand, when executed will do so immediately without going back to the calling method.</p>

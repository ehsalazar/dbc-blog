I spent 80 hours of this past week physically at Dev Bootcamp’s San Francisco location. In addition, I likely spent another 20 plus hours working on projects from home. While on campus, I was never the first to arrive and not nearly the last to leave. I knew coming into the program that much would be expected, including my time. While It’s been tiring at times, it’s also more rewarding than I ever imagined.

A couple of years ago, the company that I worked for made some staffing decisions that required managers to move from 40 hours to 45 hours per work week. While it wasn’t a drastic change, it was met with some vexation. I’m now putting in more than double that commitment and I’m strangely happier than I’ve been in years. Here are a few take-aways from the last couple of weeks that have contributed to that.

  * We’ve been pounded these last two weeks with new languages and technologies. ActiveRecord, Sinatra and Rails were all relatively unknowns, at least to me. That said, I’ve found I’ve come to excel in the realm of data and databases and seem to be making headway into internet paths and RESTful routes. This upcoming week will reintroduce us to JavaScript, HTML and CSS as well as jQuery. The goal being that we’ll be able to create more well rounded and dynamic applications.

  * Moments of clarity and “aha!” are coming more rapidly and are building upon the concepts we’ve been exposed to. As part of the application process for Dev Bootcamp, I was asked during a Skype call to work through a logic challenge to represent every calendar day of a month using only two dice of which I could choose how to number each side. It was a fun challenge to talk through but one I didn't solve. Despite that, I was obviously accepted into the program and to be honest hadn’t given it any thought since. Then, just a few nights ago, I dreamt of the challenge and came to a working solution. It’s a random example and one that excited me none the less.

  * I’ve made some peace with my confusion and with myself overall. Something we’ve been told, repeatedly over the last four weeks, is that we need to shift from a success paradigm to a failure based paradigm. In other words, stop looking for everything to be OK and start getting excited by failure. Embrace error messages, stumbling blocks and “wait, what?” moments, as they can be our biggest teachers.

While I truly am happier that I’ve been in years, this has also been the hardest and most challenging thing I’ve taken on professionally. Of course I still have moments of self-doubt and feel like I’m the most clueless one in my cohort. I’ve ended plenty of days exhausted and chosen bed over reading. I even consider daily, the possibility of repeating this current phase to ensure I’m at the level I need to be at. At the end of the day, I’m learning this time commitment may be more about a commitment to myself and my growth even more so than to any particular trade or technical skill, and that excites me.

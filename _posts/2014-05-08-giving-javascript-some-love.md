In my quest to become a web developer I’ve been exposed to a few different coding languages. While I’m sure I’ll be learning many more, so far I’ve become familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Ruby. What has struck me, is the ubiquitous nature of JavaScript. If your not familiar, JavaScript is a dynamic, mostly object-based programming language. In simple terms, that means that within the language, we can not only create objects but also manipulate them. JavaScript (JS for shorthand) is most often considered a scripting language that can run locally from a user’s web browser.

If you’ve ever opened up your web browser and gone to your favorite site, you have in all likelihood, encountered JS running in the background. It’s what helps transform a static website into an interactive site. Log into a social media site…interactive. Log into a shopping site…interactive. Accessed your favorite site on your mobile device…more than likely, interactive.

Developed in the mid-1990’s, JS spent its early years not feeling much love as it was seen as a tool for beginners and people writing for the web rather than a true programming language used to build the back-end side of advanced software programs. By the early-2000’s however, it was picking up attention and praise. And now, in the last few years, JS has become one of the most ubiquitous and popular languages on the web.

This progression make sense, especially when you consider how we as a society have evolved and embraced the web into many aspects of our daily lives. The addition of mobile devices has served to intensify this growth and popularity. We no longer want to just look at a website, we want to interact with it and have it respond to us, making for the perfect marriage between HTML and JS.

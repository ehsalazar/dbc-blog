So we’ve been told that confusion is a stage of learning. Without it, there’s no opening for new knowledge or information. I hope that’s true, as this is where I spent most of my time this past week. Right when I thought a concept was clear or a solution at hand, it was proved otherwise. While that may seem discouraging, there were also sparks of clarity (few, but they were there).

Remember last week when I said I thought the easy part was behind me and that it may be more challenging going forward? Well, I was right. That said, it wasn’t at all a discouraging realization. With challenge come opportunity. Here are my take-aways from this past week.

  * This feeling of confusion is something I need to settle into. I don’t see it going away anytime soon and in fact, I don’t want it to. While feeling completely confused can be challenging, it also comes with the awareness that there is something new here for me to explore. For the last few years, I gained new skills and tools but never really challenged myself to go beyond that comfort zone of already established knowledge. This is clearly opening up that possibility.

  * We spend some time this past week discussing superego. I won’t go into great detail except to say it’s that voice in your head that isn’t always the nicest. It came in loud and clear this week offering tidbit such as “you’re not smart enough”, “you’re holding your teammates back” and “get out now, you’ll never be successful at this anyway.” My area of opportunity around superego is in acknowledging its presence rather than accepting its truth.

  * One of the many challenges we worked on this past week was to build a ToDo application. Like everything else this week, it was confusing but ultimately successful. I present my application’s ToDo list without further comment.

    1. read and skim MORE
    2. learn to program
    3. make an appointment with Sefora (Dev Bootcamp’s in-house counselor)
    4. eat cookies - marked as complete
    5. STOP listening to superego

While this past week was personally challenging, it was also insightful. I got pushed to my limits and was able to examine how I reacted to that. Beyond that, it also helped expand those limits for next time. I wasn’t expecting this process to be all sunshine and unicorns and I’m glad its proving not to be. I step up to the confusion and welcome it as a opportunity, both as a student in this program but more importantly, as a life-long learner.

We’ve talked some over the last few weeks about Ruby, a dynamic object-oriented programming language, and some of the ways it can be used. One of the more common applications is to pair it with Rails, a productive web-application framework. The combination of the two creates Ruby on Rails, more commonly known as Rails.

So what exactly is Rails? It was written in Ruby by Danish programmer [David Heinemeier Hansson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Heinemeier_Hansson). It was developed out of his work on Basecamp, a project management tool which was being built by 37signals. It was released as open source in 2004 and achieved a milestone in late 2006 when Apple announced that it would ship Ruby on Rails with its next operating system release, Mac  OS X v10.5 “Leopard.” Since then, Rails has continued to gain momentum and popularity and has released its latest version, Rails 4.1, just this past April.

Rails includes tools that help make web development easier. Its framework is used to develop database-backed web applications. The official Rails Guides describe it as such.

> Rails is a web application development framework written in the Ruby language. It is designed to make programming web applications easier by making assumptions about what every developer needs to get started. It allows you to write less code while accomplishing more than many other languages and frameworks. Experienced Rails developers also report that it makes web application development more fun.

At its core, it’s based around these two guiding principles:

> * Don’t Repeat Yourself: DRY is a principle of software development which states that "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system." By not writing the same information over and over again, our code is more maintainable, more extensible, and less buggy.
* Convention Over Configuration: Rails has opinions about the best way to do many things in a web application, and defaults to this set of conventions, rather than require that you specify every minutiae through endless configuration files.

### Learn More

While I’m still relatively new to Ruby and Rails, I can see the benefit of this dynamic pairing. If you're curious to learn more about what exactly Rails is, check out these resources.

* [RailsGuides - Getting Started with Rails](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html)
* [Wikipedia - Ruby on Rails](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails)

As I dive deeper into my work with Ruby and databases, I’m sure Rails, with all of its features, will be a key component.

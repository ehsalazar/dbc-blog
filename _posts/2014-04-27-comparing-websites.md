Let's look at three different websites. I'm going to discuss a bit about each and give my thoughts. First, I'll explain why I'm focusing on this particular website. Additionally I'll be considering the purpose of the site. Next, what do I think of the design and its visual impact. I'll also share my perspective on the site's content and layout. Finally, I'll let you in on my connection or feelings about the particular site. Let's jump in.

### [drbronner.com](https://www.drbronner.com/)

I'm a fan of Dr. Bronner's both for their products and for their company philosophies. Their website is primarily for commerce with a secondary purpose of educating its consumers. From a design perspective, I find the website clean and simple. Adjectives I would also equate to its product. I find the site to be vibrant, impactful and appealing. Build upon a white and light grey backdrop, it adds statement photographs to draw you in. As for layout, the site is functional and easy to navigate. The homepage's large body image provides a call to action while below are five additional topics to consider. Overall, I enjoy exploring the site. It makes me proud of the product the company provides while also leaving me more informed and better educated.

### [fivethirtyeight.com](http://fivethirtyeight.com/)

This site is a relatively new addition to the crowded pool of online news outlets. Its primary purpose is to inform its users from a data driven perspective. What I like about this site is how it goes about that and how it sets its self apart from other outlets. I find the site's design to be straight forward and uncomplicated. It makes impactful use of color in its menus and article pages while remaining uncluttered and tasteful. The content of the site is purposeful and engaging, with the end user in mind. The colored menus established on the homepage translate throughout the site for ease and relatability. While I wasn't drawn to the site for its sports articles as most are, I find I've come to appreciate its other features including often ingenious uses of charts and graphs.

### [fancy.com](http://fancy.com/)

I've been a fancy fan for a few years. I checkout the site more as a window shopper rather than an actual shopper. That might not align with the sites purpose of commerce but I enjoy it none the less. To imagine the site's design, think curated shopping. Built on a clean and cool background, the product's images are elegant and ordered. The square detailed images on the homepage give a gallery impression. Only a small amount of informational text is added until you click through to learn more. The layout is customizable within limits to ensure its refined nature remains intact. It's approachable but can become more complicated as social aspects and purchasing began to tie in. I've yet to buy from the site but I am charmed and inspired by its presentation and unique products.

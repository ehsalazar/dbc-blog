The curriculum that Dev Bootcamp has developed is broken down into phases. Phase 0 is nine weeks of remote learning followed by nine weeks of in-person learning encompassing Phase 1 - 3. I’m coming to the end of week three in the Phase 0 curriculum and have already learned a good amount, both in the technical sense but also in what I can expect from the Dev Bootcamp culture when I step foot into an actual classroom.

### Kitchen or Table

This past week,  we watched a video entitled “Fireside Chat with Shereef.” In essence, it was a welcome Q&A chat hosted by, Shereef Bishay, one of the founders of Dev Bootcamp. In it, he shared the history and evolution of the program as well as shared his hopes for the new students to come. He also made an interesting distinction or analogy concerning the culture of the program which is largely shaped by each new cohort or group of students beginning their journey.
					
The analogy goes as follows. Most participants who enter the program come with one of two mindsets. Either they look to be a consumer or a creator. The consumer sits at the table and orders a product of the menu. They pay this in exchange for that. The creator on the other hand, enters the kitchen and seeks to make something. They ask, if I put this into the recipe, what can I get out in return. There was no judgement of either of the mindsets, and in fact many will fluctuate between both at different times. There was however, some distinction in the outcomes said mindsets could offer.
					
While the consumer/table is typical and in many ways natural in our culture, it can be safe and as such limiting. The creator/kitchen however, takes risk but offers potential rewards. I can walk into Dev Bootcamp or any situation for that matter and say “this doesn’t look as I expected” or “I want what I paid for.” Alternatively, I can walk into Dev Bootcamp and say “how can I contribute to the outcomes” or “what if by sharing I can enrich someone besides myself.”

I understand that curriculum, programs and companies change and evolve. I would expect nothing less, especially entering into a technology industry. A popular coding language today might be very different only one or two years from now. By moving beyond ordering a tool off the menu and rather looking at how I can contribute to the industry’s recipe, I become party to the outcome. I too am changing and evolving. Even in only three weeks, through online communities and groups, video chats, emails and messaging, we’ve started to build a dynamic new culture. I’m immensely excited for Phase 1 and meeting everyone in person and taking that culture to a whole new level.
